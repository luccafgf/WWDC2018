# WWDC 2018
The purpose of this interactive Playground is to simulate a visually impaired experience on a normal day! I used the SpriteKit to simulate a 3D virtual sound experience in this Playground. 

## Motivation
The idea of simulating a visually impaired experience came naturally to me because I passed my last moments studying and researching about how these people live and interact with the world, especially with Apps ðŸ“±.

Because of my interest and experience with visually impaired people, I found it worthwhile to simulate what it would be like to go to WWDC being one. The idea is that we can value and give more attention to these people, and that we can also perceive the richness of this human sense so rich that is the hearing.
