# WWDC 2018
The purpose of this interactive Playground is to simulate a visually impaired experience on a normal day! I used the SpriteKit to simulate a 3D virtual sound experience in this Playground. 

*Thank you Milena Ferraz and Bruna Oliveira for lending me their beautiful voices so I could make my playground ðŸ˜Š*
Sound effects obtained from [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com)
